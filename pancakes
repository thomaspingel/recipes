3 large free-range eggs
125 g plain flour
250 ml milk
unsalted butter

Method
Crack the eggs into a blender, then add the flour, milk and 1 pinch of sea salt, and blitz until smooth.
Pour into a bowl and leave to stand for 15 minutes.
Melt the butter (or a drizzle of oil if you want to be a bit healthier) in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, then tilt the pan so the butter coats the surface.
Pour in 1 ladle of batter and tilt again, so that the batter spreads all over the base, then cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it starts to come away from the sides.
Once golden underneath, flip the pancake over and cook for 1 further minute, or until cooked through.
Serve straightaway with your favourite topping.
